## Application Design

The whole of the app is easily navigable by the links in the navbars to the top and left sides of the screen.

- Users can sign up for an account, and then login and logout.
- Upon login, the user can view their own profile page as well as other user profile pages.
- The user can update their profile when logged in to their account.
- The user can view a list of tags, add new tags to their profile, as well as delete tags from their profile.
- The user can view people with the same tags and send peer requests.
- The person who receives a peer request can accept or reject it.
- After a peer request is accepted, the user will be added to the peer list page.
- The inbox is available for peers who have connected to message each other back and forth.
